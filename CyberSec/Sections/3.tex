\end{itemize}

\textbf{Comparison}

The result given from \textit{nextcloud.sdu.dk} looks alot like the outcome of querying the IP address \textit{sdu.dk}.
The IP range for "nextcloud.sdu.dk" differs, spanning from 130.225.128.0 to 130.225.159.255.


\subsection{Question: nmap}
To configure Nmap scans for sending packets with specific IP options and for MAC address spoofing, you would utilize the following.

\subsubsection{Send packets with specified ip options}
For setting specific IP options in the packets you send, the \textit{--ip-options} is used. This allows you to include various IP options required for the scan.

\subsubsection{Spoof your MAC address}
To spoof your MAC address, the \textit{--spoof-mac} option is employed. This can be used to input a particular MAC address or to instruct Nmap to generate a random one for the scan.

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Completing the Assessment - Final report}

\textbf{Security Synopsis:}
The assessment indicates that the Linux platform contains several critical vulnerabilities, with remote code execution and reverse shell capabilities among them.
These issues are severe and could result in full system compromise.

\textbf{Prioritization and Remediation Strategy:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Immediate Action: Services with the potential for remote code execution, like FTP running ProFTPD 1.3.5, are to be prioritized for urgent patching due to their high criticality.
    \item Regular Updates: Following immediate mitigation, a regime of regular updates and patches is crucial to maintain a secure state.
    \item Ongoing Vigilance: Tools such as GVM should be employed for continuous monitoring and regular security assessments to identify and patch any new vulnerabilities promptly.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Critical Vulnerabilities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{FTP - ProFTPD 1.3.5 (CVE-2015-3306)}: High risk due to the possibility of unauthorized access and control over the system.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Systems exhibiting critical vulnerabilities should be taken offline and updated to secure versions before being reinstated.
    \item Implement continuous monitoring systems to detect and rectify new vulnerabilities.
    \item Conduct regular security training for employees to mitigate risks from social engineering attacks.
    \item Perform systematic security audits to stay ahead of potential security threats.
\end{itemize}
