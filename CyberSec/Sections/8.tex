Using the STRIDE model for security threat modeling, which includes Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege, we assess the following for the given web application architecture:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spoofing:} Attackers could impersonate legitimate users if the Authentication service is compromised.
    \item \textbf{Tampering:} The Data could be altered if the communication between the Backend and Database is not secure.
    \item \textbf{Repudiation:} Without proper logging, malicious actions could be performed without traceability.
    \item \textbf{Information Disclosure:} Sensitive data might be exposed if the Database is not adequately protected.
    \item \textbf{Denial of Service (DoS):} The App could be made unavailable if the Backend or Frontend are overwhelmed with traffic.
    \item \textbf{Elevation of Privilege:} Attackers could gain unauthorized privileges if there are vulnerabilities in the Authentication process.
\end{itemize}

To ensure robust security, each component should be fortified against these potential threats.
